# Generate Password Challenge 03

_Chalange overview__

```
As a student at a coding bootcamp, I was presented with a homework challenge to complete the javascript code for a random secure password generator.
```

## My task 

when a user clicks the button to generate a password
THEN they  are  presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

WHEN prompted for password criteria,
THEN the user  selects which criteria to include in the password.

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
 the user is presented with  choice  length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128.

 Then user entery is validated for correct information before moving on to  a series of confirm questions  asking if the user would like to include numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, or lower case letters in the password. 

 If user selects  cancel on all confirm questions, then the user is alerted that they must choose at least one character type and asked to try again.

 WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is written to the page
